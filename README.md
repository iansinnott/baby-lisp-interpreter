# baby-lisp-interpreter

I wanted to learn more about compilation so I started looking at some resources:

- The Tiny Compiler: https://github.com/jamiebuilds/the-super-tiny-compiler/blob/master/the-super-tiny-compiler.js
- Risp: https://stopa.io/post/222
  - Lispy, which I found through Stepan's post: http://norvig.com/lispy.html

## Usage

You can run the REPL through Lein

```
$ lein run -m baby-lisp-interpreter.repl
```
